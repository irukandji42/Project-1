## 1. Initialize Necessary Libraries and Variables
- Import required modules for environment handling, HTTP requests, GUI, threading, queue management, and time handling.
- Set up an input queue for tasks, a request counter, and a variable to track the last request time.
- Load environment variables and retrieve the OpenAI API key.
- Define a constant for the request limit per minute and initialize a queue to track request times.

## 2. Define Utility Functions
- **can_make_request**: Determines if a new request can be made based on the request limit and timing.
- **record_request_time**: Records the current time when a request is made.
- **manage_context_dynamic**: Manages chat history to ensure it does not exceed the maximum token count.
- **generate_prompt**: Constructs a prompt for the AI based on the role and chat history.
- **ask_openai**: Sends a request to the OpenAI API with dynamic context management and handles the response.
- **handle_rate_limit**: Manages the request rate to comply with the OpenAI API's rate limits.

## 3. Define Core Chat Functionality
- **chat_with_ai**: Main function to handle the chat interaction with the AI, managing roles, prompts, and iterations.
  - For each iteration, generate a prompt based on the role and chat history.
  - Send the prompt to the OpenAI API via the ask_openai function.
  - Update the chat history and UI with the response.
  - Alternate roles between iterations.
  - Apply rate limit handling after each request.

## 4. Setup GUI Components for User Interaction
- Initialize the main window with a title.
- Create a scrolled text area for output display, disabling direct user input.
- Add buttons for starting the conversation and quitting, linking them to their respective functions.

## 5. Start the Application
- Begin a new thread for the chat_with_ai function to handle chat interactions independently of the GUI.
- Run the main event loop of the GUI to keep the application responsive.
