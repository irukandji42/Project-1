You have provided a detailed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation for a GitHub Repository Data Fetcher. This web interface allows users to input a GitHub repository in the format owner/repo, fetch and display the repository's folder structure, view file contents, and offer functionalities like copying code to clipboard and a placeholder for submitting reviews. The design focuses on a dark mode theme with responsive elements and interactive components.
